				<p class="about">Almost 5 stars because the service is unparalleled! If I dropped my napkin someone was there to replace it before I even noticed it fell. Super sharp,Attentive and charming. The bottle of flowers red wine was lovely! Expensive but wonderful. My only negative comments is that the lump crab app didn't taste too fresh or impressive and the side of creamed spinach was too salty! I would skip seafood here and get to the meat of the matter ;) shared the porterhouse for two- holy moly is that thing huge!!!!! But it's probably the best, most flavorful, tender and perfectly cooked steak I have had in ages! Superb! The leftovers were amazing with my steak and eggs at home too! Every bite of steak gets better and better! Come here if carnivorous with a good wine palate.</p>
